Feedback is always nice when network requests are happening, so now the Get Link button will display a loading graphic while the application is generating an ID

**Added a FAQ**

Along with a single, lonesome question/answer

**Added performance monitoring**

One for me really, I will now be able to keep track of how long it takes to generate URL ID's

### Feature

**Automatically update the browser URL after a URL has been generated for a link**

This will ensure that once a list has been saved, the user won't be able to accidentally lose that list
by navigating away from the page. It will still be in their browser history.
