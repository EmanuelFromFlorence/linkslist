          Links List does not store any users data. When getting a link to share a list, only the links that are added to
          the list will be saved to the database, as well as some customisation options (theme colour and view mode).
        </p>
        <p>
          At no point is there any identifiable information saved to the Links List database.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whilst Links List doesn't make lists searchable or provide a directory of lists, if anyone were to guess a URL,
          then they will be able to view that list. With this in mind, sensitive links/information should be added to a
          list at the users own risk.

          Google analytics is attached to the site, tracking user visits in order to gauge user interest.

          Bugsnag is also installed on the site, tracking errors that occur. It doesnâ€™t capture any personal
          information, only information regarding a specific error, if one occurs.
